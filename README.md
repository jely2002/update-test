### FAQ
#### 1.  I can't open a video I downloaded
Sometimes a video gets downloaded in a format that isn't supported by all media players. This can be fixed by watching the video in VLC media player, or by transcoding it to another format.
#### 2. How do I download private videos?
Please take a look at the tutorial on this subject. It can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/jely2002/youtube-dl-gui/wiki/Tutorial:-Private-videos-&-playlists).
#### 4. How do I build from source?
First, clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/jely2002/youtube-dl-gui.git`.

Then navigate to the directory and install the npm modules by executing: `npm install`.

The last step is to build using electron-builder [(documentation)](https://www.electron.build/cli). For example, the command to build a windows installer is: `npx electron-builder --win`. The output files can be found in the 'dist' folder.

Please be aware that this app is only tested on windows, linux and macOS. If you decide to build for another platform/archtype it may or may not work. Builds other than those available in the releases come with absolutely no warranty.
